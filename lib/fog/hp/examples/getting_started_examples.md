#Ruby Fog Bindings Examples for use with HP Cloud Services

This section includes code examples for working with Ruby Fog bindings and HP Cloud. HP Cloud recently updated their service to version 13.5, so make sure you use the HP Cloud Compute 13.5 examples, HP Cloud Block Storage 13.5, and the HP Cloud Networking examples only with the the latest version. The CDN and object storage examples work in both 12.12 and 13.5.
